## Overview
This project explores the application of deep learning techniques within the realm of Big Data to enhance recommendation systems. By leveraging large datasets, the aim is to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and personalization of recommendations provided to users. This integration seeks to address the challenges of scalability and dynamic adaptation in recommendation systems across various domains such as e-commerce, entertainment, and social networking services.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Data Management:** Assessment of storage and management requirements for handling Big Data in recommendation systems.
- **System Design:** Evaluation of architectural patterns suitable for distributed Big Data systems used in recommendation engines.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Critical analysis and selection of neural network algorithms for processing large-scale datasets, emphasizing scalability and real-time processing capabilities.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system-bigdata.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the project and analyze the outcomes:
1. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```
   jupyter notebook recommendation_system_demo.ipynb
   ```
2. **Execute the cells sequentially** to walk through the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and recommendation generation process.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.x for neural network models
- Apache Spark for Big Data processing
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation

## Data
This project utilizes the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which contains millions of movie ratings. Preprocessing steps include normalization, user and item embedding, and data splitting for training and testing purposes.

## Features and Algorithms
- **Feature Engineering:** User demographics, movie metadata, and rating patterns are utilized as features.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A collaborative filtering approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture the complex patterns in user-item interactions.

## Results
The implementation demonstrates significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and personalization compared to traditional methods. Metrics such as Precision@K, Recall@K, and F1 Score are used to evaluate performance.

## Limitations and Future Work
- **Scalability:** While the project shows promising results, further optimization is needed for real-world scalability.
- **Dynamic Data:** Future iterations will explore models that can adapt more dynamically to new data without full retraining.
